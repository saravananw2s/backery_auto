If you have questions with the guide, feel free to leave them as issues in the repository. If you find a typo, create a pull request. The idea is to keep the content up to date and use github’s native feature to help tell the story with issues and PR’s, which are all searchable via google. Why? Because odds are if you have a question, someone else does too! You can learn more here at about how to contribute.\r\n\r\n*By contributing to this repository you are agreeing to make your content available subject to the license of this repository.*\r\n\r\n### Process\r\n    1.
